          useDesc="Love the phone. Display is awesome. Ui feels smooth and snappy. But while playing BGMI if I get a call the phone lags a bit. Battery performance is decent. Charging is fast. Camera quality is average. Main sensor takes good photos but ultra wide and macro camera performance is not good as per price. Overall a value for money phone under 40k.
          OnePlus is also providing lifetime screen replacement so you can trust the brand."

          userTitle="Excellent laptop for gaming!"
          useDesc="After using rigorously for 3 months I can say this is very good gaming laptop. I bought it in 82k with offers. The specifications laptop have is great with the price it asks. I will definitely suggest this laptop if you need decent graphic card in which you can almost play all games with beautiful settings. I have apply transparent cover to it with lining so please ignore it."

          userTitle="Excellent Bag, but a little tight on space!"
          useDesc="If you're a Pilot or Student this is absolute Bang for a Buck! The best of the best!!! Neve saw this king of attention to details. Best for CFI's for sure. Buy and don't look back! Everything in the bag is luxury and heavy duty as you want to expect from this kind of expensive item. Unlike Brightline, where everything is thin and flimsy this one is just built for pilot by pilot. One thing they can improve is to do a smaller version, just for headset and iPad + bottle. But no complaints, everyone have a different needs and they achieve most of the pilot requirements."
